1 - id Tech series

This tool is an important series when it comes to PC gaming history. It's first version, id Tech 1 was the basis used to create the original Doom game,
which went on to popularize the FPS format. As technology advanced, later versions of the engine would be developed, like id Tech 2 and 3 which 
allowed for 3D real time rendering and were used for the first 3 Quake games and Return to Castle Wolfenstien. The next big jump would be with id Tech 5
where they introduced MegaTexture 2.0, which allowed for one very large texture to be used for terrain instead of many much smaller ones, creating much more
detailed and intricate environments. id Tech 5 was used for games like Rage, Wolfenstein: The New Order, and The Evil Within. The newest evolution of this game
engine is id Tech 8, which features destructable environments, and has currently only been used for Doom: The Dark Ages, which released earlier this year.
