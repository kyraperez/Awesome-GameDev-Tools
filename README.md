1 - id Tech series
This series of engines are very important when it comes to PC gaming history. It's first version, id Tech 1 was 
the basis used to create the original Doom game, which went on to popularize the FPS format. As technology advanced, 
later versions of the engine would be developed, like id Tech 2 and 3 which allowed for 3D real time rendering and 
were used for the first 3 Quake games and Return to Castle Wolfenstien. The next big jump would be with id Tech 5
where they introduced MegaTexture 2.0, which allowed for one very large texture to be used for terrain instead of 
many much smaller ones, creating much moredetailed and intricate environments. id Tech 5 was used for games like Rage, 
Wolfenstein: The New Order, and The Evil Within. The newest evolution of this game engine is id Tech 8, which features 
destructable environments, and has currently only been used for Doom: The Dark Ages, which released earlier this year.
